# Amadeus
A side project that aims to replicate the Amadeus App shown in Steins;Gate 0 for Android.

I'm creating this mainly for cosplay purposes, thus the design takes priority over actual functionality.
Hit me up on the Steins;Gate Discord.

Many thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/SG_EPK_X29">EPK</a> for providing the voice lines and <a href="https://github.com/RIP95">Emojikage</a>
for implementing voice recognition!
